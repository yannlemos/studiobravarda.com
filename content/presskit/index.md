<b>Description</b>

Studio Bravarda is a game development company based in Lisbon, Portugal. It was founded by a group of Brazilian partners with the goal to develop premium indie games with Brazilian flavors, crafting unique stories based on the partners' shared culture, history and experiences.

<b>Our Story</b>

The spiritual embryo of Studio Bravarda was created back when its six original members were attending their university courses in Rio de Janeiro, between 2015 and 2016. The team was built around the idea of a gigantic epic fantasy RPG game, called “Bravura”. However, as most first games go, the idea was too big and the members realized they wouldn't be able to make it after a few months of development. Still, the project united the group, at that time of 5 people (Cezar, João, Mabel, Mateus and Yann), so they named the studio after the game, calling themselves “Bravarda”. The name embodied a belief of facing a challenge with no guarantee that you are going to make it - to be brave and believe that one day, they would be a studio making games professionally.

It was about that time when they participated in their first game jam, making a small Game Maker project using only the words “Spider" and “Fruit" as a base. Then they, obviously, made a prototype about a fruit-juggling spider. The game jam allowed the group to really tap into what the full process of making a game was like. From that moment on, they started developing small projects, in game jams and course assignments, learning different aspects of game making, one step at a time.

In 2016, some of the studio's members were pivotal to the founding of the game development student group RPG - Rio PUC Games, which later became Prisma Game Lab. While in the group, they met and welcomed the last member to become a Bravarda, Nicolas Leme. In 2017, they participated in the Ludum Dare 38 and developed the game “The Underventure of Polin” in 72h. The game landed in the top 200 games in several categories, out of more than 3000 games participating. In 2018-2019, the members collectively helped each other with their undergraduate thesis projects, while Yann and Nicolas helped to found Campus Studio, a game company mainly focused on serious games inside Instituto Genêsis, a Business Incubator from PUC-Rio University. The founders gained valuable B2B experience during their time in Campus Studio, where they developed projects for big companies in Brazil, such as Fundação Roberto Marinho,  TV Channel Futura and Eletrobras.

Finally, in 2020, with almost all of the members graduated from university, the group managed to sync everyone logistically to the objective of finally operating as the studio that they had been preparing for years to start: Studio Bravarda, a horizontal co-owned game company.
